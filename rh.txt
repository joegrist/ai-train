When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Aeroplane
Do I mean what I mean
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
A yousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

I wrapped you inside of my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before, before, before

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause Ied be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends
Am I really sinking this low

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a pare of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a pare of the human race
Race, race, race

Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Youed kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow

And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These youghts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Please, could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

What's that
I may be paranoid, but not an android
What's that
I may be paranoid, but not an android

When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

What's that
I may be paranoid, but no android
What's that
I may be paranoid, but no android

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name
I guess he does

Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving Rain down
The crackle of pigskin Rain down
The dust and the screaming Come on, rain down
The yuppies networking On me
The panic, the vomit From a great height
The panic, the vomit From a great height
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah


The breath of the daying I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that theyed swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as Ied love to see it
Ied tell all my friends but theyed never believe me
Theyed think that Ied finally lost it completely
Ied show them the stars and the meaning of life
Theyed shut me away but Ied be alright, alright
Mom, I'm alright, alright

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight

Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke

We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke

ransport, motorways and tramlines
Stareing and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back

And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
You know where you are
Hysterical and useless
You know where you are
Hysterical and
You know where you are

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her parey

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym Three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well No bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at Moral bank hole in wall
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash Also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self employed
Concerned But powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics

I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
It's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I will be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls


A heare that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises
Get me out of here
No alarms and no surprises
Get me out of here
No alarms and no surprises, please
Get me out of here

I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edge

It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a flowing
No one else would know

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a yousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids

Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

Ied really like to help you, man
Ied really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

Nobody wants to be a slave

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life

Beautiful angel
Pulled apare at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes up five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes up five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

I sailed the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars

Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon

Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting

This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

Uh, uh, uh 

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

You fell into our, you fell into our

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

4, 5, 6, 7
Get to heaven

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take pare
Where I end and where you stare
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the pareing of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

I will eat you alive

Are you hungry
Are you sick
Are you begging for a break
Are you sweet
Are you fresh
Are you strung up by the wrists

We want the young blood

Are you fracturing
Are you torn at the seams
Would you do anything
Flea bitten, moth eaten

We suck young blood
We suck young blood

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha ha, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming

In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out
Steer away from these rocks
Weed be a walking disaster
Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder

There, there

Why so green and lonely
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up

Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes eyes

No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to stare a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch up at a wedding, yeah

Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot

The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch up at a wedding, yeah

No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no


The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive

My youghts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smareass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing  I miss you 
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Walking like giant cranes and
With my X ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list
Stepford wives, who are we to complain
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish youed get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone

Blow into this paper bag

Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Come on, come on

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

Like they were honeybees or a plague of rats
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Blow into this paper bag
Blow into this paper bag

How come I end up where I stareed
How come I end up where I went wrong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I stareed
How come I end up where I went wrong
I won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone

One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a sheer drop

How come I end up where I stareed
How can I end up where I went wrong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out and you cut the string

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong

Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out

You killed the sound
Removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass

Has the light gone out for you
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
On the lines wrapped around my face
On the lines wrapped around my face
Are for anyone else to see
Are for anyone else to see

I'm a lie

I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here
Why should I stay

Ied be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings

I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car

I am all of the days
That you choose to igore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's alright
It's all wrong
It's alright

Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again off again on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns

Fingers in
The blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel not
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We yought you had it in you
But not not not
For no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
I take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel not
What you ought to what you ought to
The elephant that's in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
Duplicate and triplicate
Plastic bags and
In duplicate and triplicate

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed stuffed stuffed
We yought you had it in you
But not not not
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

You've got a head full of feathers
You're gonna melt into butter

Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet dis tractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore

Reckoner, take me with yer

Dedicated to all human beings

I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it stares

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
And get swept under

Denial, denial
Denial, denial

Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial...

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again

The walls are bending shape
You got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn off shotguns

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back and you look back
Not just once
And not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light you can feel it on your back
You got the light you can feel it on your back
Your Jigsaw falling into place

When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape
My videotape

When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in
Red blue green, in
Red blue green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape...

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before...

No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know
Today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen

Get yourself together, let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen wiyout warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup
Down is the new up, is the new up

Won't you be my girl Won't you be my girl

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, wiyout a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip flop
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

You crawled off and left us, you crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You bastard
You bastard

You're on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

ver here, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't get it, but now I can see

That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out

Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

I'm stuck in the TARDIS
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder
We're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder
We wait for your mistake

Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same

You bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me
And now I want more

I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers and the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up

Chief of police or vice chancellor
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
I got the poison, poison
And now I want more

If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour

If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down, when I go down

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall

Yeah, because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
The poison, I got the poison
I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison

This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

This is your warning, four minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is our warning, four minute warning

Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt
Don't blow your mind with whys

I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults
Turning in somersaults
A giant turtle's eyes
A giant turtle's eyes
As jellyfish float by
Jellyfish float by

You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it off, give it back
You stole it off, give it back

Good daying, Mr. Magpie
How are we today
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

Good daying, Mr. Magpie
How are we today
Now you've stolen all my magic
Took my melody

I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heare
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heare
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heare

We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heare
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the bird that's flown into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heare

Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong

Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Gather up the lost and their souls Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Gather up the pitiful Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me

Into your arms
What seems impossible Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms
I think I have had my fill Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
I think I should give up the ghost
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me
Into your arms Don't hurt me

It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heare
In my mouth

Like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
Did so much, did so much

I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over Wake me up
Then you're wrong Wake me up
If you think this is over Wake me up
Then you're wrong Wake me up

Like I've fallen out of bed Wake me up
From a long and vivid dream Wake me up
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying Wake me up, wake me up

When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up
Wake me up, will you wake me up
Wake me up, will you wake me up
Wake me up, will you wake me up

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times

Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heare
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didn't know
Totally alive, totally released

Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a yousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
You, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible

You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop

Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up All the good times
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again

You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time

Hey, it's me, I just got off the train
A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around
Buy another ticket The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh so smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care

I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold

A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me

The sweet faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

But now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know

Broken heares make it rain
Broken heares make it rain
Broken heares make it rain
Broken heares make it rain
Broken heares make it rain

Broken heares make it rain

The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know

It touches like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

One day at a time
One day at a time

We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

One day at a time

This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self defence, of self defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I won't get heavy, don't get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
I'll be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

All the holes at once
Are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

All the birds stay up
In the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before it's too late

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Just don't leave
Don't leave

Why us
Why not someone else Why us
The cameras are turning off
Our lights so run away

And this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down the muddy river

While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions 
A delicate balance

When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down a
Muddy river

There's a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done

How, how did you go bad
Did you go bad Did you go bad
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad Did you go bad

If you're in a forest, out of your mind
Harpies in the branches breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows of shattering glass
Where you miss the moment, watching it pass

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word

When you spend your life wishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are
Buried in rubble, sixty foot down

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running

When you change your friends, like changing your clothes

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
I'll come running

I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Comin' after me, yeah
Headlights on full beam
Comin' down the fast lane
Comin' after me

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Blowin' holes in everythin'
Thatcher's children
See you on the way back down
Drooling looney tunes
Movin' in a swarm
Movin' in a swarm

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothin'
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on

Smile

That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case

After years of waiting

After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize you're looking in
Looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

After years of waiting

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

I jumped in the river and what did I see
Black eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

I jumped into the river
Black eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors

There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors

There are doors that lock and doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you can't come back from

Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Well, come on, come on

You and whose army
You and your cronies

Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

You and whose army
You and your cronies

You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses

I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again

Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do What would I do
If I did not have you

Open up and let me in

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all

Keep it moving
Keep it moving

I want you to know he's not coming back
Look into my eyes, I'm not coming back

So knives out, catch the mouse
Don't look down, shove it in your mouth

If youed been a dog, they would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out, cook him up
Squash his head, put him in the pot

I want you to know he's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out, catch the mouse
Squash his head, put him in the pot

The daying bell, the daying bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture, a bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me

Whereed you park the car
Whereed you park the car
Your clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well, I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around
And round

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me

There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear a weapon we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

Why don't you quiet down
Maybe I want peace and honesty
Why don't you quiet down
Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I
Why don't you quiet down
Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty
Why don't you quiet down
I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land
Quiet down  Yeah, and there, there we can free

You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, babies crying
It'll all over, maybe, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

Quiet down
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
Why don't you quiet down
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
Why don't you quiet down
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
Why don't you quiet down
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents

While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
And this just feels like
Spinning plates
My body's floating down the muddy river

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well of course Ied like to sit around and chat
Well of course Ied like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Ied like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house

Well of course Ied like to sit around and chat
Well of course Ied like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Ied like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only
There's someone listening in

Howed you get your
Teeth so pearly
Dew drop dentures
White washed fences

She runs from the third world, pearly

Vanilla Feel it crawl to me milkshakes Crawl back again
From Hard Rock Whatever you say Cafés Make it go away
That's where I feel it crawl to me she got her Crawls back again
Sweet tooth Make it go away for white boys Whatever you say

She runs from the third world, pearly

Use me, darling use me
Darling use me, darling use me

If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool, once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song

Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, and stare to talk shit

If I get old, remind me of this
The way that we kissed, and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song

Tears of joy now scare ourselves
From all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel
I will always be

So sell your suit and tie
And come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia
Polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

Plastic bag, middle class
Polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded
Keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

Oh
Obtain
Obtain

Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed

We just know that you'll do well
You won't come to harm

Death to all who stand in your way
Wake, my dear

In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life

In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

But I'm okay, how are you
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you
I hope you're okay, too

Every one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy
I've been kidding myself for so long

I'm okay, how are you
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you
I hope you're okay, too

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay stone
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Why can't you forget
Why can't you forget
Why can't you forget

Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time

I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones

They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She said that sheed love to come help, but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream If you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream If you think you belong enough
Nice dream If you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream If you think you belong enough

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door

One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I was bulletproof

Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bulletproof

And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof

I get home from work
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you

What are we coming to
What are we gonna do

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's 58 hours
Since that I last slept with you

What are we coming to
I just don't know anymore

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you

What am I coming to
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing me

You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
You sit there and bawl
You look so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
 
 Piping down the valleys wild,
  Piping songs of pleasant glee,
 On a cloud I saw a child,
  And he laughing said to me
 
 Pipe a song about a Lamb
  So I piped with merry cheer.
 Piper, pipe that song again
  So I piped he wept to hear.
 
 Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe
  Sing thy songs of happy cheer
 So I sang the same again,
  While he wept with joy to hear.
 
 Piper, sit you down and write
  In a book, that all may read.
 So he vanished from my sight
  And I plucked a hollow reed,
 
 And I made a rural pen,
  And I stained the water clear,
 And I wrote my happy songs
  Every child may joy to hear.
 
 
 How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot
 From the day to the evening he stays
 He shall follow his sheep all the day,
 And his tongue shall be filled with praise.
 
 For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
 And he hears the ewes' tender reply
 He is watching while they are in peace,
 For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.
 
 The sun does arise,
 And make happy the skies
 The merry bells ring
 To welcome the Spring
 The skylark and thrush,
 The birds of the bush,
 Sing louder around
 To the bells' cheerful sound
 While our sports shall be seen
 On the echoing Green.
 
 Old John, with white hair,
 Does laugh away care,
 Sitting under the oak,
 Among the old folk.
 They laugh at our play,
 And soon they all say,
 Such, such were the joys
 When we allgirls and boys  
 In our youth time were seen
 On the echoing Green.
 
 Till the little ones, weary,
 No more can be merry
 The sun does descend,
 And our sports have an end.
 Round the laps of their mothers
 Many sisters and brothers,
 Like birds in their nest,
 Are ready for rest,
 And sport no more seen
 On the darkening green.
 
 
  Little Lamb, who make you
  do you know who made you,
 Gave you life, and bid you feed
 By the stream and over the mead
 Gave you clothing of delight,
 Softest clothing, wolly, bright
 Gave you such a tender voice,
 Making all the vales rejoice
  Little Lamb, who made you
  do you know who made you
 
  Little Lamb, I'll tell you
  Little Lamb, I'll tell you
 He is called by thy name,
 For He calls Himself a Lamb
 He is meek, and He is mild,
 He became a little child.
 I a child, and you a lamb,
 We are called by His name.
  Little Lamb, God bless you
  Little Lamb, God bless you
 
 
 My mother bore me in the southern wild,
  And I  am black, but oh my soul is white
 White as an angel is the English child,
  But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
 
 My mother taught me underneath a tree,
  And, sitting down before the heat of day,
 She took me on her lap and kissed me,
  And, pointed to the east, began to say
 
 Look on the rising sun there God does live,
  And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
 And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
  Comfort in daying, joy in the noonday.
 
 And we are put on earth a little space,
  That we may learn to bear the beams of love
 And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
  Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
 
 For when our souls have learned the heat to bear,
  The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
 Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
  And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',
 
 My mother said, and kissed me
 And I say to little English boy.
 When I from black and he from white cloud free,
 And round the tent of God like lambs we joy
 
 I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
 To lean in joy upon our Father's knee
 And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
 And be like him, and he will then love me.

 
 Merry, merry sparrow
 Under leaves so green
 A happy blossom 
 Sees you, swift as arrow,
 Seek your cradle narrow,
 Near my bosom.
 Pretty, pretty robin
 Under leaves so green
 A happy blossom
 Hears you sobbing, sobbing,
 Pretty, pretty robin,
 Near my bosom.
 
 
 When my mother died I was very young,
 And my father sold me while yet my tongue
 Could scarcely cry Weep weep weep weep
 So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
 
 There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
 That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved so I said,
 Hush, Tom never mind it, for, when your head's bare,
 You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.
 
 And so he was quiet, and that very night,
 As Tom was a sleeping, he had such a sight  
 That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
 Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
 
 And by came an angel, who had a bright key,
 And he opened the coffins, and let them all free
 Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,
 And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.
 
 Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
 They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind
 And the Angel told Tom, if heed be a good boy,
 Heed have God for his father, and never want joy.
 
 And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,
 And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
 yough the daying was cold, Tom was happy and warm
 So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.

 
 Father, father, where are you going
  Oh do not walk so fast
 Speak, father, speak to you little boy,
  Or else I shall be lost.
 
 The night was dark, no father was there,
  The child was wet with dew
 The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
  And away the vapour flew.
 
 
 THE LITTLE BOY FOUND
 
 The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
  Led by the wandering light,
 Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
  Appeared like his father, in white.
 
 He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
  And to his mother brought,
 Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
  The little boy weeping sought.
 
 
 LAUGHING SONG
 
 When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
 And the dimpling stream runs laughing by
 When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
 And the green hill laughs with the noise of it
 
 when the meadows laugh with lively green,
 And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
 When Mary and Susan and Emily
 With their sweet round mouths sing Ha, ha he
 
 When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
 Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread
 Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
 To sing the sweet chorus of Ha, ha, he
 
 
 A  SONG
 
 Sweet dreams, form a shade
 over my lovely infant's head
 Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
 By happy, silent, moony beams
 
 Sweet Sleep, with soft down
 Weave thy brows an infant crown
 Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
 Hover over my happy child
 
 Sweet smiles, in the night
 Hover over my delight
 Sweet smiles, mother's smile,
 All the livelong night beguile.
 
 Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
 Chase not slumber from thine eyes
 Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
 All the dovelike moans beguile.
 
 Sleep, sleep, happy child
 All creation slept and smiled.
 Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
 While over you mother weeps.
 
 Sweet babe, in thy face
 Holy image I can trace
 Sweet babe, once like you
 Thy Maker lay, and wept for me
 
 Wept for me, for you, for all,
 When He was an infant small.
 you His image ever see,
 Heavenly face that smiles on you
 
 Smiles on you, on me, on all,
 Who became an infant small
 Infant smiles are his own smiles
 Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.
 
 
 DIVINE IMAGE
 
 To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
  All pray in their distress,
 And to these virtues of delight
  Return their thankfulness.
 
 For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
  Is God our Father dear
 And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
  Is man, his child and care.
 
 For Mercy has a human heare
  Pity, a human face
 And Love, the human form divine
  And Peace, the human dress.
 
 Then every man, of every clime,
  That prays in his distress,
 Prays to the human form divine
  Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
 
 And all must love the human form,
  In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
 Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
  There God is dwelling too.
 
 
 HOLY THURSDAY
 
 'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
 Came children walking two and two, in read, and blue, and green
 Grey headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,
 Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames waters flow.
 
 Oh what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town
 Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.
 The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
 yousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.
 
 Now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song,
 Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among
 Beneath them sit the aged man, wise guardians of the poor.
 Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.
 
 
 NIGHT
 
 The sun descending in the west,
 The evening star does shine
 The birds are silent in their nest,
 And I must seek for mine.
  The moon, like a flower
  In heaven's high bower,
  With silent delight,
  Sits and smiles on the night.
 
 Farewell, green fields and happy grove,
 Where flocks have ta'en delight.
 Where lambs have nibbled, silent move
 The feet of angels bright
  Unseen they pour blessing,
  And joy wiyout ceasing,
  On each bud and blossom,
  And each sleeping bosom.
 
 They look in every youghtless nest
 Where birds are covered warm
 They visit caves of every beast,
 To keep them all from harm
  If they see any weeping
  That should have been sleeping,
  They pour sleep on their head,
  And sit down by their bed.
 
 When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
 They pitying stand and weep
 Seeking to drive their thirst away,
 And keep them from the sheep.
  But, if they rush dreadful,
  The angels, most heedful,
  Receive each mild spirit,
  New worlds to inherit.
 
 
 And there the lion's ruddy eyes
 Shall flow with tears of gold
 And pitying the tender cries,
 And walking round the fold
  Saying Wrath by His meekness,
  And, by His health, sickness,
  Are driven away
  From our immortal day.
 
 And now beside you, bleating lamb,
 I can lie down and sleep,
 Or think on Him who bore thy name,
 Graze after you, and weep.
  For, washed in life's river,
  My bright mane for ever
  Shall shine like the gold,
  As I guard over the fold.
 
 
 SPRING
 
 Sound the flute
 Now it's mute
 Bird's delight,
 Day and night,
 Nightingale,
 In the dale,
 Lark in sky,  
 Merrily,
 Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.
 
 Little boy,
 Full of joy
 Little girl,
 Sweet and small
 Cock does crow,
 So do you
 Merry voice,
 Infant noise
 Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
 
 Little lamb,
 Here I am
 Come and lick
 My white neck
 Let me pull
 Your soft wool
 Let me kiss
 Your soft face
 Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
 
 
 NURSE'S SONG
 
 When the voices of children are heard on the green,
  And laughing is heard on the hill,
 My heare is at rest within my breast,
  And everything else is still.
 Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
  And the dews of night arise
 Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
  Till the daying appears in the skies.
 
 No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
  And we cannot go to sleep
 Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
  And the hills are all covered with sheep.
 Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,
  And then go home to bed.
 The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,
  And all the hills echoed.
 
 
 INFANT JOY
 
 I have no name
 I am but two days old.
 What shall I call you
 I happy am,
 Joy is my name.
 Sweet joy befall you
 
 Pretty joy
 Sweet joy, but two days old.
 Sweet Joy I call you
 you do smile,
 I sing the while
 Sweet joy befall you
 
 
 A DREAM
 
 Once a dream did weave a shade
 over my angel guarded bed,
 That an emmet lost its way
 Where on grass meyought I lay.
 
 Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
 Dark, benighted, travel worn,
 Over many a tangle spray,
 All heare broke, I heard her say
 
 Oh my children do they cry,
 Do they hear their father sigh
 Now they look abroad to see,
 Now return and weep for me.
 
 Pitying, I dropped a tear
 But I saw a glow worm near,
 Who replied, What wailing wight
 Calls the watchman of the night
 
 I am set to light the ground,
 While the beetle goes his round
 Follow now the beetle's hum
 Little wanderer, hie you home
 
 
 ON ANOTHER'S SORROW
 
 Can I see another's woe,
 And not be in sorrow too
 Can I see another's grief,
 And not seek for kind relief
 
 Can I see a falling tear,
 And not feel my sorrow's share
 Can a father see his child
 Weep, or be with sorrow filled
 
 Can a mother sit and hear
 An infant groan, an infant fear
 No, no  never can it be
 Never, never can it be
 
 And can He who smiles on all
 Hear the wren with sorrows small,
 Hear the small bird's grief and care,
 Hear the woes that infants bear  
 
 And not sit beside the next,
 Pouring pity in their breast,
 And not sit the cradle near,
 Weeping tear on infant's tear
 
 And not sit both night and day,
 Wiping all our tears away
 Oh no never can it be
 Never, never can it be
 
 He gives his joy to all
 He becomes an infant small,
 He becomes a man of woe,
 He feels the sorrow too.
 
 Think not you canst sigh a sigh,
 And thy Maker is not by
 Think not you canst weep a tear,
 And thy Maker is not year.
 
 Oh He gives to us his joy,
 That our grief He may destroy
 Till our grief is fled an gone
 He sits by us and moan.
 
 Hear the voice of the Bard,
 Who present, past, and future, sees
 Whose ears have heard
 The Holy Word
 That walked among the ancient tree
 
 Calling the lapsed soul,
 And weeping in the evening dew
 That might control
 The starry pole,
 And fallen, fallen light renew
 
 O earth, O earth, return
 Arise from out the dewy grass
 Night is worn,
 And the day
 Rises from the slumbrous mass.
 
 Turn away no more
 Why wilt you turn away
 The starry floor,
 The watery shore,
 Are given you till the break of day.
 
 earth raised up her head
 From the darkness dread and drear,
 Her light fled,
 Stony, dread,
 And her locks covered with grey despair.
 
 Prisoned on watery shore,
 Starry jealousy does keep my den
 Cold and hoar
 Weeping o're,
 I hear the father of the ancient men.
 
 Selfish father of men
 Cruel, jealous, selfish fear
 Can delight,
 Chained in night,
 The virgins of youth and daying bear
 
 Does spring hide its joy,
 When buds and blossoms grow
 Does the sower 
 Sow by night,
 Or the plowman in darkness plough
 
 Break this heavy chain,
 That does freeze my bones around
 Selfish, vain,
 Eternal bane,
 That free love with bondage bound.
 
 Love seeks not itself to please,
  or for itself hath any care,
 But for another gives it ease,
  And builds a heaven in hell's despair.
 
 So sang a little clod of clay,
  Trodden with the cattle's feet,
 But a pebble of the brook
  Warbled out these metres meet
 
 Love seeks only Self to please,
  To bind another to its delight,
 Joys in another's loss of ease,
  And builds a hell in heaven's despite.
 
 Is this a holy thing to see
  In a rich and fruitful land,  
 Babes reduced to misery,
  Fed with cold and usurous hand
 
 Is that trembling cry a song
  Can it be a song of joy
 And so many children poor
  It is a land of poverty
 
 And their son does never shine,
  And their fields are bleak and bare,
 And their ways are filled with thorns
  It is eternal winter there.
 
 For wherever the sun does shine,
  And wherever the rain does fall,
 Babes should never hunger there,
  or poverty the mind appall.
 
 In futurity
 I prophetic see
 That the earth from sleep
 Grave the sentence deep
 
 Shall arise, and seek
 for her Maker meek
 And the desert wild
 Become a garden mild.
 
 In the southern clime,
 Where the summer's prime
 Never fades away,
 Lovely Lyca lay.
 
 Seven summers old
 Lovely Lyca told.
 She had wandered long,
 Hearing wild birds' song.
 
 Sweet sleep, come to me
 Underneath this tree
 Do father, mother, weep
 Where can Lyca sleep
 
 Lost in desert wild
 Is your little child.
 How can Lyca sleep
 If her mother weep
 
 If her heare does ache,
 Then let Lyca wake
 If my mother sleep,
 Lyca shall not weep.
 
 Frowning, frowning night,
 over this desert bright
 Let thy moon arise,
 While I close my eyes.
 
 Sleeping Lyca lay
 While the beasts of prey,
 Come from caverns deep,
 Viewed the maid asleep.
 
 The kingly lion stood,
 And the virgin viewed
 Then he gambolled round
 over the hallowed ground.
 
 Leopards, tigers, play
 Round her as she lay
 While the lion old
 Bowed his mane of gold,
 
 And her breast did lick
 And upon her neck,
 From his eyes of flame,
 Ruby tears there came
 
 While the lioness
 Loosed her slender dress,
 And naked they conveyed
 To caves the sleeping maid.
 
 All the night in woe
 Lyca's parents go
 Over valleys deep,
 While the deserts weep.
 
 Tired and woe begone,
 Hoarse with making moan,
 Arm in arm, seven days
 They traced the desert ways.
 
 Seven nights they sleep
 Among shadows deep,
 And dream they see their child
 Starved in desert wild.
 
 Pale through pathless ways
 The fancied image strays,
 Famished, weeping, weak,
 With hollow piteous shriek.
 
 Rising from unrest,
 The trembling woman presse
 With feet of weary woe
 She could no further go.
 
 In his arms he bore
 Her, armed with sorrow sore
 Till before their way
 A couching lion lay.
 
 Turning back was vain
 Soon his heavy mane
 Bore them to the ground,
 Then he stalked around,
 
 Smelling to his prey
 But their fears allay
 When he licks their hands,
 And silent by them stands.
 
 They look upon his eyes,
 Filled with deep surprise
 And wondering behold
 A spirit armed in gold.
 
 On his head a crown,
 On his shoulders down
 Flowed his golden hair.
 Gone was all their care.
 
 Follow me, he said
 Weep not for the maid
 In my palace deep,
 Lyca lies asleep.
 
 Then they followed
 Where the vision led,
 And saw their sleeping child
 Among tigers wild.
 
 To this day they dwell
 In a lonely dell,
 or fear the wolvish howl
 or the lion's growl.
 
 A little black thing in the snow,
 Crying weep weep in notes of woe
 Where are thy father and mother Say  
 They are both gone up to the church to pray.
 
 Because I was happy upon the heath,
 And smiled among the winter's snow,
 They clothed me in the clothes of death,
 And taught me to sing the notes of woe.
 
 And because I am happy and dance and sing,
 They think they have done me no injury,
 And are gone to praise God and his priest and king,
 Who make up a heaven of our misery.
 
 When voices of children are heard on the green,
 And whisperings are in the dale,
 The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
 My face turns green and pale.
 
 Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
 And the dews of night arise
 Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
 And your winter and night in disguise.
 
 O rose, you are sick
  The invisible worm,
 That flies in the night,
  In the howling storm,
 
 Has found out thy bed
  Of crimson joy,
 And his dark secret love
  Does thy life destroy.
 
 Little Fly,
 Thy summer's play
 My youghtless hand
 Has brushed away.
 
 Am not I
 A fly like you
 Or are not you
 A man like me
 
 For I dance
 And drink, and sing,
 Till some blind hand
 Shall brush my wing.
 
 If yought is life
 And strength and breath
 And the want 
 Of yought is death
 
 Then am I
 A happy fly,
 If I live,
 Or if I die.
 
 I dreamt a dream  What can it mean
 And that I was a girl Queen
 Guarded by an Angel mild
 Witless woe was never beguiled
 
 And I wept both night and day,
 And he wiped my tears away
 And I wept both day and night,
 And hid from him my heare's delight.
 
 So he took his wings, and fled
 Then the day blushed rosy red.
 I dried my tears, and armed my fears
 With ten yousand shields and spears.
 
 Soon my Angel came again
 I was armed, he came in vain
 For the time of youth was fled,
 And grey hairs were on my head.
 
 Tiger, tiger, burning bright
 In the forest of the night,
 What immortal hand or eye
 Could Frame thy fearful symmetry
 
 In what distant deeps or skies
 Burnt the fire of thine eyes
 On what wings dare he aspire
 What the hand dare seize the fire
 
 And what shoulder and what are
 Could twist the sinews of thy heare
 And, when thy heare began to beat,
 What dread hand and what dread feet
 
 What the hammer  what the chain
 In what furnace was thy brain
 What the anvil what dread grasp
 Dare its deadly terrors clasp
 
 When the stars threw down their spears,
 And watered heaven with their tears,
 Did he smile his work to see
 Did he who made the lamb make you
 
 Tiger, tiger, burning bright
 In the forests of the night,
 What immortal hand or eye
 Dare frame thy fearful symmetry

 A flower was offered to me,
  Such a flower as May never bore
 But I said I've a pretty rose tree,
  And I passed the sweet flower over.
 
 Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
  To tend her by day and by night
 But my rose turned away with jealousy,
  And her thorns were my only delight.
 
 Ah Sunflower, weary of time,
  Who countest the steps of the sun
 Seeking after that sweet golden clime
  Where the traveller's journey is done
 
 Where the Youth pined away with desire,
  And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
 Arise from their graves, and aspire
  Where my Sunflower wishes to go
 
 The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
 The humble sheep a threatening horn
 While the Lily white shall in love delight,
 or a thorn or a threat stain her beauty bright.
 
 I laid me down upon a bank,
  Where Love lay sleeping
 I heard among the rushes dank
  Weeping, weeping.
 
 Then I went to the heath and the wild,
  To the thistles and thorns of the waste
 And they told me how they were beguiled,
  Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.
 
 I went to the Garden of Love,
  And saw what I never had seen
 A Chapel was built in the midst,
  Where I used to play on the green.
 
 And the gates of this Chapel were shut
  And you shalt not, writ over the door
 So I turned to the Garden of Love
  That so many sweet flowers bore.
 
 And I saw it was filled with graves,
  And tombstones where flowers should be
 And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
  And binding with briars my joys and desires.

 
 Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold
 But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.
 Besides, I can tell where I am used well
 The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.
 
 But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,
 And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
 Weed sing and weed pray all the livelong day,
 or ever once wish from the Church to stray.
 
 Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
 And weed be as happy as birds in the spring
 And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
 Would not have bandy children, or fasting, or birch.
 
 And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
 His children as pleasant and happy as he,
 Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
 But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.
 
 I wandered through each chareered street,
  Near where the chareered Thames does flow,
 A mark in every face I meet,
  Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
 
 In every cry of every man,
  In every infant's cry of fear,
 In every voice, in every ban,
  The mind forged manacles I hear
 
 How the chimney sweeper's cry
  Every blackening church appals,
 And the hapless soldier's sigh
  Runs in blood down palace walls.
 
 But most, through midnight streets I hear
  How the youthful harlot's curse
 Blasts the new born infant's tear,
  And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.
 
 Pity would be no more
 If we did not make somebody poor,
 And Mercy no more could be
 If all were as happy as we.
 
 And mutual fear brings Peace,
 Till the selfish loves increase
 Then Cruelty knits a snare,
 And spreads his baits with care.
 
 He sits down with his holy fears,
 And waters the ground with tears
 Then Humility takes its root
 Underneath his foot.
 
 Soon spreads the dismal shade
 Of Mystery over his head,
 And the caterpillar and fly
 Feed on the Mystery.
 
 And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
 Ruddy and sweet to eat,
 And the raven his nest has made
 In its thickest shade.
 
 The gods of the earth and sea
 Sought through nature to find this tree,
 But their search was all in vain
 There grows one in the human Brain.
 
 My mother groaned, my father wept
 Into the dangerous world I leapt,
 Helpless, naked, piping loud,
 Like a fiend hid in a cloud.
 
 Struggling in my father's hands,
 Striving against my swaddling bands,
 Bound and weary, I yought best
 To sulk upon my mother's breast.
 
 
 I was angry with my friend
 I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
 I was angry with my foe
 I told it not, my wrath did grow.
 
 And I watered it in fears
 Night and daying with my tears,
 And I sunned it with smiles
 And with soft deceitful wiles.
 
 And it grew both day and night,
 Till it bore an apple bright,
 And my foe beheld it shine,
 and he knew that it was mine,  
 
 And into my garden stole
 When the night had veiled the pole
 In the daying, glad, I see
 My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
 
 
 Nought loves another as itself,
  or venerates another so,
 or is it possible to yought
  A greater than itself to know.
 
 And, father, how can I love you 
  Or any of my brothers more
 I love you like the little bird
  That picks up crumbs around the door.
 
 The Priest sat by and heard the child
  In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
 He led him by his little coat,
  And all admired the priestly care. 
 
 And standing on the altar high,
  Lo, what a fiend is here said he
 One who sets reason up for judge
  Of our most holy mystery.
 
 The weeping child could not be heard,
  The weeping parents wept in vain
 They stripped him to his little shirt,
  And bound him in an iron chain,
 
 And burned him in a holy place
  Where many had been burned before
 The weeping parents wept in vain.
  Are such thing done on Albion's shore
 
 
 Children of the future age,
 Reading this indignant page,
 Know that in a former time
 Love, sweet love, was yought a crime.
 
 In the age of gold,
 Free from winter's cold,
 Youth and girl bright,
 To the holy light,
 Naked in the sunny beams delight.
 
 Once a youthful pair,
 Filled with softest care,
 Met in garden bright
 Where the holy light
 Had just removed the curtains of the night.
 
 Then, in rising day,
 On the grass they play
 Parents were afar,
 Strangers came not near,
 And the girl soon forgot her fear.
 
 Tired with kisses sweet,
 They agree to meet
 When the silent sleep
 Waves over heaven's deep,
 And the weary tired wanderers weep.
 
 To her father white
 Came the girl bright
 But his loving look,
 Like the holy book
 All her tender limbs with terror shook.
 
 Ona, pale and weak,
 To thy father speak
 Oh the trembling fear
 Oh the dismal care
 That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair
 
 I love to rise on a summer day, 
  When birds are singing on every tree
 The distant huntsman winds his horn,
  And the skylark sings with me
  Oh what sweet company
 
 But to go to school in a summer day,  
  Oh it drives all joy away
 Under a cruel eye outworn,
  The little ones spend the day
  In sighing and dismay.
 
 Ah then at times I drooping sit,
  And spend many an anxious hour
 or in my book can I take delight,
  or sit in learning's bower,
  Worn through with the dreary shower.
 
 How can the bird that is born for joy
  Sit in a cage and sing
 How can a child, when fears annoy,
  But droop his tender wing,
  And forget his youthful spring
 
 Oh father and mother, if buds are nipped,
  And blossoms blown away
 And if the tender plants are stripped
  Of their joy in the springing day,
  By sorrow and care's dismay,  
 
 How shall the summer arise in joy,
  Or the summer fruits appear
 Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
  Or bless the mellowing year,
  When the blasts of winter appear
 
 
 Whatever is born of mortal birth
 Must be consumed with the earth,
 To rise from generation free
 Then what have I to do with you
 The sexes sprang from shame and pride,
 Blown in the day, in evening died
 But mercy changed death into sleep
 The sexes rose to work and weep.
 
 you, mother of my mortal pare,
 With cruelty did mould my heare,
 And with false self deceiving tears
 did bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,
 
 did close my tongue in senseless clay,
 And me to mortal life betray.
 The death of Jesus set me free
 Then what have I to do with you
 

 Youth of delight  come hither
 And see the opening day,
 Image of Truth new born.
 Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,
 Dark disputes and areful teazing.
 Folly is an endless maze
 Tangled roots perplex her ways
 How many have fallen there
 They stumble all night over bones of the dead
 And feelthey know not what but care
 And wish to lead others, when they should be led.
 
 Cruelty has a human heare,
  And Jealousy a human face
 Terror the human form divine,
  And Secresy the human dress.
 
 The human dress is forged iron,
  The human form a fiery forge,
 The human face a furnace sealed,
  The human heare its hungry gorge.


Does the Eagle know what is in the pit
Or wilt you go ask the Mole
Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod
Or Love in a golden bowl

The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,
All but the youngest she in paleness sought the secret air.
To fade away like daying beauty from her mortal day
Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard
And thus her gentle lamentation falls like daying dew.

O life of this our spring  why fades the lotus of the water
Why fade these children of the spring born but to smile and fall.
Ah Thel is like a watry bow, and like a pareing cloud,
Like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water
Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infants face.
Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air
Ah gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head.
And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice 
Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.

The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass
answered the lovely maid and said I am a watry weed,
And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales
So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head
Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all
Walks in the valley, and each day over me spreads his hand
Saying, rejoice you humble grass, you new born lily flower.
you gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks
For you shall be clothed in light, and fed with daying manna
Till summers heat melts you beside the fountains and the springs
To flourish in eternal vales they why should Thel complain.
Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.

She ceased and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.

Thel answered, O you little virgin of the peaceful valley.
Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the over tired
The breath nourishes the innocent lamb, he smells the milky garments
He crops thy flowers while you sittest smiling in his face,
Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.
Thy wine purifies the golden honey thy perfume.
Which you do scatter on every little blade of grass that springs
Revives the milked cow, and tames the fire breathing steed.
But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun
I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place.

Queen of the vales the Lily answered, ask the tender cloud,
And it shall tell you why it glitters in the daying sky.
And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.
Descend O little cloud and hover before the eyes of Thel.

The Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head
And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.


O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge you to tell me
Why you complainest now when in one hour you fade away
Then we shall seek you but not find ah Thel is like to you.
I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.

The Cloud then shewd his golden head and his bright form emerged.
Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.

O virgin knows our steeds drink of the golden springs
Where he renews his horses lookst you on my youth.
And fears you because I vanish and am seen no more.
Nothing remains O maid I tell you, when I pass away.
It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy
Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers
And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent
The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun.
Till we arise linked in a golden band and never pare
But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.

do you O little cloud  I fear that I am not like you
For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers
But I feed not the little flowers I hear the warbling birds,
But I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food
But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away
And all shall say, wiyout a use this shining women lived,
Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms.

The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answered.

Then if you are the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,
How great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives.
Lives not alone or or itself fear not and I will call,
The weak worm from its lowly bed, and you shalt hear its voice.
Come forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.

The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,
And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his parener in the vale.


III.

Then Thel astonished viewed the Worm upon its dewy bed.

are you a Worm  image of weakness. are you but a Worm
I see you like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf
Ah weep not little voice, you can not speak, but you can weep
Is this a Worm  I see they lay helpless and naked weeping
And none to answer, none to cherish you with mothers smiles.

The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice and raised her pitying head
She bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald
In milky fondness, then on Thel she fixed her humble eyes

O beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,
you seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed
My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,

But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head
And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.
And says you mother of my children, I have loved you
And I have given you a crown that none can take away.
But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know
I ponder, and I cannot ponder yet I live and love.

The daughter of beauty wiped her pitying tears with her white veil,
And said, Alas  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep
That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot
That wilful bruised its helpless form but that he cherished it
With milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,
And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.
And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.

Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answered I heard thy sighs.
And all thy moans flew over my roof, but I have called them down
Wilt you O Queen enter my house, tis given you to enter,
And to return fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.

The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the orthern bar
Thel entered in and saw the secrets of the land unknown
She saw the couches of the dead, and where the fibrous roots
Of every heare on earth infixes deep its restless twists
A land of sorrows and of tears where never smile was seen.

She wandered in the land of clouds through valleys dark, listning
Dolors and lamentations waiting oft beside the dewy grave
She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,
Till to her own grave plot she came, and there she sat down.
And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.

Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction
Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile
Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,
Where a yousand fighting men in ambush lie
Or an Eye of gifts and graces showring fruits and coined gold

Why a Tongue impressed with honey from every wind
Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright
Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy
Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire

The Virgin stareed from her seat, and with a shriek,
Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har




The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
Jerusalem.

Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
all is vanity.

What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
the sun?

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
but the earth abideth for ever.

The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
his place where he arose.

The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
again according to his circuits.

All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
again.

All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
thing under the sun.

Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
shall come after.

I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
therewith.

I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
is wanting cannot be numbered.

I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
experience of wisdom and knowledge.

And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow.

I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
vineyards:

I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
all kind of fruits:

I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
bringeth forth trees:

I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
instruments, and that of all sorts.

So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
the sun.

And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
which hath been already done.

Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
excelleth darkness.

The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
to them all.

Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
spirit.

Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
also vanity.

Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun.

For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
and a great evil.

For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
under the heaven:

A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
time to pluck up that which is planted;

A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
a time to build up;

A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
time to dance;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing;

A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
to cast away;

A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
a time to speak;

A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
of peace.

What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
men to be exercised in it.

He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
rejoice, and to do good in his life.

And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
doeth it, that men should fear before him.

That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
already been; and God requireth that which is past.

And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
iniquity was there.

I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
every work.

I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
they themselves are beasts.

For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
dust again.

Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
the living which are yet alive.

Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
and vexation of spirit.

The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
with travail and vexation of spirit.

Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
their labour.

For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
help him up.

Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
one be warm alone?

And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
threefold cord is not quickly broken.

Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
king, who will no more be admonished.

For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor.

I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead.

There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
consider not that they do evil.

Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
shouldest vow and not pay.

Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
hands?

For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
divers vanities: but fear thou God.

If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
regardeth; and there be higher than they.

Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
is served by the field.

He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
of them with their eyes?

The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
sleep.

There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
son, and there is nothing in his hand.

As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
he may carry away in his hand.

And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
the wind?

All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
God giveth him: for it is his portion.

Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
common among men:

A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
untimely birth is better than he.

For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
his name shall be covered with darkness.

Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
hath more rest than the other.

Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
seen no good: do not all go to one place?

All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
is not filled.

For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
that knoweth to walk before the living?

Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
he.

Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
the better?

For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
death than the day of one's birth.

It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
living will lay it to his heart.

Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better.

The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
hear the song of fools.

For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
of the fool: this also is vanity.

Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
the heart.

Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
the bosom of fools.

Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
this.

Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
to them that see the sun.

For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
that have it.

Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
which he hath made crooked?

In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
shouldest thou die before thy time?

It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
shall come forth of them all.

Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
are in the city.

For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
sinneth not.

Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
hear thy servant curse thee:

For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
likewise hast cursed others.

All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
it was far from me.

That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
out?

I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
one, to find out the account:

Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
found.

Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
but they have sought out many inventions.

Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
boldness of his face shall be changed.

I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
regard of the oath of God.

Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
unto him, What doest thou?

Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
the misery of man is great upon him.

For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
when it shall be?

There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it.

All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
ruleth over another to his own hurt.

And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
they had so done: this is also vanity.

Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
in them to do evil.

Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him:

But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
not before God.

There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
is vanity.

Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
which God giveth him under the sun.

When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
to find it.

For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
all that is before them.

All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
a living dog is better than a dead lion.

For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten.

Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
thing that is done under the sun.

Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
ointment.

Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
the grave, whither thou goest.

I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
falleth suddenly upon them.

This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
great unto me:

There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
bulwarks against it:

Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
poor man.

Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
him that ruleth among fools.

Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
destroyeth much good.

Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
reputation for wisdom and honour.

A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
his left.

Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
fool.

If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
which proceedeth from the ruler:

Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
servants upon the earth.

He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
babbler is no better.

The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
a fool will swallow up himself.

The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
he knoweth not how to go to the city.

Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
eat in the morning!

Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
drunkenness!

By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all things.

Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
many days.

Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
not what evil shall be upon the earth.

If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
eyes to behold the sun:

But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
that cometh is vanity.

Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
say, I have no pleasure in them;

While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
be darkened,

And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
the streets:

Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
broken at the cistern.

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
and set in order many proverbs.

The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
which was written was upright, even words of truth.

The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
flesh.

Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
