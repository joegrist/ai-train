When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Aeroplane
Do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

I wrapped you inside of my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before, before, before

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
Race, race, race

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow

And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah


The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away but I'd be alright, alright
Mom, I'm alright, alright

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight

Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke

We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke

ransport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back

And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and
(You know where you are)

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

Concerned (But powerless)
An empowered and informed member of society (Pragmatism not idealism)
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet (Shot of baby strapped in back seat)
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit (The ability to laugh at weakness)
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics

I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
It's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I will be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls


A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)

I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edge

It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowing
No one else would know

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids

Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can

Where'd you park the car?

Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture

Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round

Everybody wants to be a friend

Nobody wants to be a slave

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life

Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes up five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes up five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

I sailed the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars

Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon

Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting

This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

Uh, uh, uh!

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

You fell into our, you fell into our

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

4, 5, 6, 7
(Get to heaven)

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood

Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?

We suck young blood
We suck young blood

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour

It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you

Funny, ha-ha, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming

In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)

There, there

Why so green and lonely?
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up

Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes eyes

No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot

The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no


The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone

Blow into this paper bag

Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Come on, come on

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

Like they were honeybees or a plague of rats
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Blow into this paper bag
Blow into this paper bag

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
I won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?

One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a sheer drop

How come I end up where I started?
How can I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out and you cut the string

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong

Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out

You killed the sound
Removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass

Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
On the lines wrapped around my face
On the lines wrapped around my face
Are for anyone else to see
Are for anyone else to see

I'm a lie

I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings

I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car

I am all of the days
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's alright
It's all wrong
It's alright

Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again off again on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns

Fingers in
The blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel not
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not not not
For no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
I take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel not
What you ought to what you ought to
The elephant that's in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
Duplicate and triplicate
Plastic bags and
In duplicate and triplicate

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed stuffed stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not not not
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

You've got a head full of feathers
You're gonna melt into butter

Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet dis-tractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore

Reckoner, take me with yer

Dedicated to all human beings

I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
And get swept under

Denial, denial
Denial, denial

Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
(Denial...)

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again

The walls are bending shape
You got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn off shotguns

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back and you look back
Not just once
And not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light you can feel it on your back
You got the light you can feel it on your back
Your Jigsaw falling into place

When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape
My videotape

When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in
Red blue green, in
Red blue green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape...

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before...

No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know
Today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen

Get yourself together, let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up, is the new up

Won't you be my girl? Won't you be my girl?

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

You crawled off and left us, you crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You bastard
You bastard

You're on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

ver here, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't get it, but now I can see

That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out

Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

I'm stuck in the TARDIS
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder
We're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder
We wait for your mistake

Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same

You bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me
And now I want more

I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers and the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up

Chief of police or vice chancellor
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
I got the poison, poison
And now I want more

If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour

If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down, when I go down

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall

Yeah, because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
The poison, I got the poison
I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison

This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

This is your warning, four minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is our warning, four minute warning
